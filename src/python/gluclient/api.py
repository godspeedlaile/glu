"""
Definition of the GluClient API.

Exports all you need to work with the Glu client API.

Makes available the following classes:

    - L{GluClientException}
    - L{GluServer}
    - L{GluComponent}
    - L{GluParameter}
    - L{GluService}
    - L{GluAccessibleService}
    - L{GluResource}
    - L{GluResourceTemplate}

Important: None of these objects should be created directly
by the client, except the L{GluServer} object. All other
objects are created for you by various methods on those
objects.

Therefore, in the documentation of this package, the only
__init__() method of interest to the client developer is the
one in the L{GluServer} class.
